## üéØ Objectives
1. Show overall performance (Total Sales, Total Orders, Total Quantity, Avg Order Value, Distinct Customers, Return %).
2. Visualize **Sales Trend Over Time** (Year-Month).
3. Identify **Top Products by Quantity**.
4. Identify **Top Categories by Revenue** (based on `StockCode`/Category or your categorical field).
5. Enable filtering by **Year** and **Month**.

---

## üìä Key Measures (DAX)
> Replace `Table`/column names with yours.

```DAX
-- Core
Total Sales = SUMX(Table, Table[Quantity] * Table[Price])
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Table[Invoice])
Total Quantity = SUM(Table[Quantity])
Distinct Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Table[CustomerID])
Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])

-- Returns (if you have a returns flag/quantity)
Return Orders = CALCULATE([Total Orders], Table[IsReturn] = TRUE())
Return % = DIVIDE([Return Orders], [Total Orders])

-- Time helpers
Year = YEAR(Table[InvoiceDate])
Month Name = FORMAT(Table[InvoiceDate], "MMMM")
Month Number = MONTH(Table[InvoiceDate])
Year-Month = FORMAT(Table[InvoiceDate], "YYYY-MMM")

Task 2 - Student Event Feedback Analysis

## üìå Task Overview
This task focuses on analyzing student feedback collected from an event.  
The dataset includes responses to multiple questions with ratings, comments, and engagement metrics.  
The goal is to identify patterns, compute average ratings, and visualize insights using Power BI.

---

## üîë Objectives
- Clean and structure the feedback dataset.
- Calculate average ratings per question.
- Identify key trends in student satisfaction.
- Create visualizations for better understanding.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)  
- **Excel / CSV** (Data Source)  
- **DAX** (Measures for calculations like average ratings)  

---

## üìä Key Insights
- **Average Rating** per question was computed and visualized.  
- **Bar chart** representation showed variation in feedback across questions.  
- Identified questions with relatively lower satisfaction, which can be improved in future events.  

---


---

## üöÄ Learning Outcomes
- Learned to create **custom DAX measures** (e.g., Average Ratings).  
- Gained experience in designing **question-wise dashboards**.  
- Improved understanding of **feedback analytics and reporting**.
