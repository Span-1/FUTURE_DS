-- Core
Total Sales = SUMX(Table, Table[Quantity] * Table[Price])
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Table[Invoice])
Total Quantity = SUM(Table[Quantity])
Distinct Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Table[CustomerID])
Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])

-- Returns (if you have a returns flag/quantity)
Return Orders = CALCULATE([Total Orders], Table[IsReturn] = TRUE())
Return % = DIVIDE([Return Orders], [Total Orders])

-- Time helpers
Year = YEAR(Table[InvoiceDate])
Month Name = FORMAT(Table[InvoiceDate], "MMMM")
Month Number = MONTH(Table[InvoiceDate])
Year-Month = FORMAT(Table[InvoiceDate], "YYYY-MMM")
